### API Basics

# Rest API is the standard across the entire internet
# URI = Universal Resource Identifier
# HTTP = Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
# HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language
    # <a> uses Anchor Tags <a>

# can also do a URI post instead of URL get

# Constraints to be considered Restful
    # 1. Client-Server Architecture
    # 2. Statelessness
    # 3. Layered System
    # 4. Cacheability
    # 5. Uniform Design
    # 6. Code on Demand

# go to developers page and utilize API to generate anything

# APIs use JSON across the board
    # some older ones use XML but that is not ideal anymore

# different types of restpoints
    #

# REST is communicating over the web.
    # instead of requesting HTML, you request JSON
# many times the API is in a subdirectory or subdomain
    # api.facebook.com/ or facebook.com/api/

# Security and versatility is considered in the API
    # they all share the same backend on the server which is why you can send a message on phone or computer
    # you can change your backend without changing your frontend as long as it is linked
    # you can make some endpoints public to have others create their own version of the website/app
